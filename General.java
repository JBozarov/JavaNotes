METHOD OVERLOADING / OVERRIDING 

Method overriding is child class uses own method which is a same as name of parent class's method ( you change ) 

Method overloading ( happens within the class ) so class uses same name to create multiple methods with different parameters 
  ( Amir said same name but different parameters  
  JS has not overloading, last method will be invoked But Java will invoke the one which number of parameters match 
  
  
Concrete method is method has a body definition, opposite of abstract method 

Abstaraction defining method without body and whoever wants to use they can define the method body and use it 100% abstraction is Interfaces 

Polymorphism using same method multiple times from child classes to 

Inheritence child class uses parent class methods properties using extends 
   
   
   Association => One class is related to another class
   IS A => inheritance Car IS A vehicle, Dog IS A(n) Animal
   HAS A => Car HAS A Engine 
   composition 
   aggregation 
   School is a Building, School has a library 
   
   subclass is a class which is inheriting from parent class 
   super class parent class which is being inherited class 
   
   
   Access modifiers 
   private ( available in class only use getter and setters ) 
   public ( available in entire project ) 
   protected ( availble in class, subclass 
   package 
   Non access modifiers 
   static no instance
   final const in js
   abstract thread safety
   synchronized(multithreading) 
   
   
   SUPER 
   super() refers to default constructor of Parent. If you code a constructor with data in Parent then you 
   call super with the data in constructor of Child class.
   
   That's where you want to use protected. When you want only inherited classes to be able to access 
   your class. It's a neat little way to hide stuff from unrelated classes
