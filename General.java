METHOD OVERLOADING / OVERRIDING 

Method overriding is child class uses own method which is a same as name of parent class's method ( you change ) 

Method overloading ( happens within the class ) so class uses same name to create multiple methods with different parameters 
  ( Amir said same name but different parameters  
  JS has not overloading, last method will be invoked But Java will invoke the one which number of parameters match 
  
  
Concrete method is method has a body definition, opposite of abstract method 

Abstaraction defining method without body and whoever wants to use they can define the method body and use it 100% abstraction is Interfaces 

Polymorphism using same method multiple times from child classes to 

Inheritence child class uses parent class methods properties using extends
